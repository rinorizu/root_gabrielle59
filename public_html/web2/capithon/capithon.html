        <p>I was part of the graphic and designing part of the team.
            I created 2 different versions of the business cards for the Thinkflow company.
            I made a forest green one and a cream coloured business card.

        <p>HOS.1.4 Stay focused and on task</p>
        <p>With everyone and different teams being everywhere in the M building, i found it a little challenging
            to stay focused, because so much was going on. Based on my my comment/ opinion, i would say i was a Level 4.
