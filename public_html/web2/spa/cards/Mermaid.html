            <p class="text">Mermaids have a unique allure that has captivated people throughout history. 
                Myths of half-human, half-fish creatures can be traced all the way back to ancient Babylon. 
                Similarly, merpeople are featured in Syrian, Polynesian, and Greek mythology. 
                While some cultures depicted mermaids as beautiful and romantic (in Irish folklore, mermaids could transform into human form and marry humans), 
                sometimes mermaid stories took on a more sinister tone where they were capable of foretelling and bringing disaster.</p>

            <img src="../img/the empress.jpg" id="tarot" alt="">
            <p class="text">The Empress depicts a woman sitting on a throne. From the abundant nature that surrounds her, we can assume that this woman represents the 
                Earth Mother archetype, a goddess of fertility. Her world is ruled by venus which means that there is complete love, harmony, fertility and luxury by the 
                grace of this goddess. The woman herself has blonde hair crowned with stars, signaling her divine connection with the mystical realm. She is dressed in a 
                pomegranate-patterned robe that represents fertility, and she is seated on cushions embroidered with a venus sign. 
                She is surrounded by an enchanting green forest with a river streaming through it. 
                The Empress brings abundance and blessings in the readings of those she meets.</p>
