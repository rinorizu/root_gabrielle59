            <p class="text">Faeries, also known as fairies, fey, or fae, can be traced back to Old French medieval romance stories.
                 These supernatural creatures or spirits are popular across a wide variety of myths, legends, and stories, leading up to the present day. 
                 Generally, when we think of fairies or faeries, we think of small, winged, magical creatures. However, faeries were rarely depicted with wings outside of Victorian artwork.
                 In folk tales, faeries flew using magic and occasionally caught a ride on the back of a friendly bird!</p>

            <p class="text">In the Emperor tarot card, a stoic ruler figure can be seen on his throne, which is adorned with the heads of four rams, representing his astrological sign - Aries.
                 In one hand, he carries a scepter, representing his reign and his right to rule, and in the other an orb, a symbol of the kingdom that he watches over.
                  The long beard of the emperor represents his vast experience; over time he has learned much about what it takes to rule, to establish power, authority and complete order for the benefit of his people.</p>
