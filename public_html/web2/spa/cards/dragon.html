            <p class="text">Dragons are giant serpent-like, winged monsters that have been featured in myths from all around the world. 
                Despite being so well-known, the origin of the dragon myth is something of a mystery. 
                Furthermore, there are some cultures that believe that the creatures are not in fact mythical, 
                but rather giant creatures who had previously died out, like dinosaurs.</p>

            <p class="text">The Ace of Blades shows a hand emerging from the clouds wielding a double-edged sword. This double edged sword carries a golden crown while being encircled by a wreath. The wreath has for a long time been associated with victory, success and great achievement.
                The crown is used as the symbol for both royalty and the power to rule that comes with royalty.  
                Behind the foreground, the sword stands floating over a varied setting - which holds both mountains and sea, 
                which are used as symbols of the vast reach and distant lands that the swords can be used to conquer, as well as ambition. </p>
