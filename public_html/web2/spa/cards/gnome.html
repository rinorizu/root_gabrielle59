        <h1>The Gnome and The Hermit</h1>

            <p class="text">When you think of a gnome, you might picture your standard garden gnome: a small, cheerful guardian of flora and fauna. 
                In some senses, this depiction isnâ€™t entirely incorrect. 
                In European folklore, dwarf-like earth spirits called gnomes guarded underground treasures. 
                Medieval myths depicted gnomes as creatures resembling little old men, often with hunched over backs.</p>

            <img src="../img/the hermit.jpg" id="tarot" alt="">
            <p class="text">The Hermit depicts an old man standing alone at the peak of the mountain while holding a lantern in one of his hands and a staff on the other. 
                The mountain denotes accomplishment, development, and success. 
                The hermit tarot card refers to the level of spiritual knowledge that he attained, and that he is ready to impart that knowledge to everyone. 
                There is also a deep commitment he has to his goal and a solid awareness of the path that he is taking. Inside the lantern, you will notice a star with 6 points which is also known as the Seal of Solomon. 
                This symbol represents wisdom. The staff that he holds depicts authority and power.</p>
