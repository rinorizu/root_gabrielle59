        <h1>The Phoenix and The High Priestess</h1>

            <p class="text">The phoenix is a mythical eagle-like creature, generally known for bursting 
                into flame at the end of their life, only to emerge from the ashes as a young phoenix. 
                In both ancient Egyptian and Classical myth, the phoenix was associated with sun worship and was depicted as a 
                large bird, with gold and red feathers that could live for hundreds of years. 
                The phoenix was a symbol of immortality, eternity, and resurrection.</p>

            <p class="text">You've most likely encountered the High Priestess before, but in other forms - she can be seen in the archetypes of Persephone, 
                Artemis, Isis and many more. When you encounter her, you will see her sitting on a cubic stone between the two pillars at Solomonâ€™s Temple, Jachin, and Boaz.
                 Jachin (right) is generally referred to as the Pillar of Establishment and Boaz (left) is the Pillar of Strength.
                 The pillars also depict the duality of nature; masculine and feminine, good and evil, negative and positive.</p>
